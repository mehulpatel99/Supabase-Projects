## Introduction
In this project, I explored the capabilities of Supabase as a powerful backend solution. The key features implemented include:

- User authentication
- Image upload and storage
- CRUD functionality for managing data

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

## Authentication
This project implements user authentication using Supabase's built-in authentication services. Users can sign up, log in, and manage their sessions seamlessly.

## Image Storage
Images are stored using Supabase Storage. Users can upload images, which are then securely stored and can be retrieved for display in the application.

## CRUD Operations
The application supports full CRUD operations:
- **Create**: Add new entries.
- **Read**: Display entries to users.
- **Update**: Modify existing entries.
- **Delete**: Remove entries as needed.
